            <p>APPUiO allows you to orchestrate and manage containers with Kubernetes. You define how many of your application instances should run in parallel and Kubernetes then takes care of scaling, load balancing and stability.</p>
            <p>The concept of Kubernetes is described in the ebook „The state of the Kubernetes Ecosystem“. It serves as a primer for both newcomers, assessors and implementers who are looking to make the most of the ecosystem of products and services emerging around Kubernetes. </p>
            <p>We are proud to be mentioned with APPUiO among big international brands in this ebook. It motivates to go on working with Kubernetes and bring each day more services to the cloud. </p>

  title: "Introduction to OpenShift on Exoscale"
  subtitle: "OpenShift is to Kubernetes similar to what a Linux distribution is to the kernel. In this blogpost we show how to integrate OpenShift on <a target=\"_new\" href=\"https://www.exoscale.ch\">Exoscale</a>"
  details: |
            <p>The world is talking about the <a target="_new" rel="noopener" href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes Project</a></a> - but did you hear about OpenShift? It’s an open source product based on the open source projects Kubernetes and Docker plus a container builder/registry, and a Web GUI to manage it all. This blog post will introduce you to OpenShift and give some hints why to use it, how to get started, and where you can get professional support and managed services.</p>
            <h4>What is OpenShift and why should you use it?</h4>
            <p>It describes itself as “the industry’s most secure and comprehensive enterprise-grade container platform based on industry standards, Docker and Kubernetes”. It’s much more than that - it gives you a complete Kubernetes cluster with many cool features: integrated build pipelines, Docker Registry, Application router (for getting traffic into the cluster), security based on RBAC and SELinux, Web Console for easy access, central logging of all Pod output, Metrics to measure Pod performance, Installation and upgrade using Ansible Playbooks, Source-to-Image builds, and much much more.</p>
            <p>As a Linux distribution acts to the Linux Kernel, OpenShift is a Kubernetes distribution with all the needed tools and tricks to make full use of it.</p>
            <p>OpenShift comes in two flavors:</p>
            <p><ul>
            <li><a target="_new" rel="noopener" href="https://www.openshift.com/container-platform/">OpenShift Container Platform</a>: Software product to install in your data center and get support by Red Hat.</li>
            <li><a target="_new" rel="noopener" href="https://www.openshift.org/">OpenShift Origin</a>: The open source upstream project with a very active GitHub <a target="_new" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/openshift/origin">repository</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="/images/feature_process.svg" alt="continuous process"/>
            </p>
            <p>OpenShift enables you to develop faster - after committing your changes in GIT it solves container image build, storage, deploy, scaling, monitoring, and logging for you so you don’t have to do it. The integrated build and deployment processes help you get the developed application to the customer as fast as possible. It enables you to deploy hourly or even faster, and scale computing resources per project automatically with your user base.</p>
            <h4>How to get started?</h4>
            <p>There are many many ways to get started, here are a few hints and examples:</p>
            <p><ul>
            <li>Install your own OpenShift cluster for example on Exoscale with the official <a target="_new" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible">Ansible Playbooks</a>. By using these playbooks you learn to customize every inch of the installation and configuration, and they also help you upgrade from one version to another. Documentation about these playbooks can be found inside the Git repository or on the <a target="_new" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/install/advanced_install.html">documentation page</a>.</li>
            <li>Start a local OpenShift cluster on your workstation with <a target="_new" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/minishift/minishift">Minishift</a> (based on Minikube) or with the fancy command oc cluster up. Just download the client binary from the GitHub <a target="_new" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases">releases page</a>, unpack it, and then run the oc cluster up command. This will launch a complete OpenShift instance on your local Docker Engine:</li>

            <pre><code>% oc cluster up
            Starting OpenShift using openshift/origin:v3.6.0 ...
            Pulling image openshift/origin:v3.6.0

            Pulled 2/4 layers, 83% complete
            Pulled 3/4 layers, 88% complete

            The server is accessible via web console at:
                https://127.0.0.1:8443

            You are logged in as:
                User: developer
                Password: &lt;any value&gt;

            To login as administrator:
                oc login -u system:admin
            % oc new-app https://github.com/appuio/example-php-sti-helloworld.git
            [...]
            % oc expose svc example-php-sti-helloworld
            [...]
            % curl -s http://example-php-sti-helloworld-myproject.127.0.0.1.nip.io/ | grep title
                <title>APPUiO PHP Demo</title>
            </code></pre>

            <li>Have a look at the APPUiO <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/appuio/techlab">Techlabs</a> on GitHub which is a free step-by-step introduction to get started. We offer free <a target="_new" href="https://appuio.ch/techlabs.html">half-day workshops</a>.</li>
            <li>The APPUiO <a target="_new" href="http://docs.appuio.ch/en/latest/services/01_introduction.html">Microservices Example</a> documentation gives some insight for developers on how a Microservice application can be built and deployed on OpenShift, describing tools like Gitlab CI and Jenkins for the build pipelines.</li></ul></p>
            <p>There is a lot of documentation available from upstream. It’s a great source to read about every little detail. You’ll find documentation for both the <a target="_new" href="https://docs.openshift.com/">OpenShift Container Platform</a> and <a target="_new" href="https://docs.openshift.org/">OpenShift Origin</a>. APPUiO also provides a <a target="_new" href="http://docs.appuio.ch/en/latest/services/01_introduction.html">community-driven documentation</a>.</p>

  title: "One Year of Techlabs in Retrospect"
  subtitle: ""
  details: "
            <p><strong>It has been a year since <a target=\"new\" href=\"https://www.puzzle.ch/blog/articles/2016/07/18/rueckblick-auf-das-openshift-tech-lab-in-zuerich\">my first retrospection onto an APPUiO & OpenShift Techlab</a>;  a year and fourteen additional techlabs. And as it's common in such a long time, a lot of things have changed: OpenShift has meanwhile graduated to version 3.5 and its webinterface, compared to version 3.1 back then, has become a lot more powerful and intuitive. But then there are things that remained constant as well, not least among them the lively interest in our Techlabs.</strong></p>
            <p>When we updated OpenShift to version 3.4 a lot of things changed for APPUiO. Due to the more intuitive webinterface many operations are now accomplishable by the click of a mouse. This helps new developers to get acquainted. Nevertheless, it’s obvious that there still are quite a few challenges for starting with APPUiO, as demonstrated by the sheer number of participants and the unbroken interest in our Techlabs in both Berne and Zurich. Developers are still participating in large numbers and learning the most important steps to deploying applications into the cloud hands-on.</p>
            <p>Other things have stayed tried-and-true, among them the basic concepts of containers. But also my happiness seeing participants getting excited about the technical possibilities they’re offered by OpenShift. And then there are some matters that keep coming up during the Techlabs. One of the questions raised most often is how to to deploy your specifically coded applications onto OpenShift. There are three fundamental ways to do that:</p>
            <p><ul>
              <li>OpenShift compiles the application-pod from the pure source-code, using the integrated Source-to-Image-Framework. During this process, it automatically identifies the language in question.</li>
              <li>OpenShift builds the application-pod using a provided Docker-file. To do that, the Docker image is built, pushed into the internal registry and finally deployed.</li>
              <li>OpenShift simply uses a pre-built Docker image and deploys it. (see also: <a target=\"new\" href=\"https://access.redhat.com/articles/2897391\">reference architecture</a>)</li>
            </ul></p>
            <img alt=\"APPUiO OpenShift S2I Deployment Pipeline\" src=\"/images/Blog-Cover-Openshift-03-980x654.png\"/>
            <p><i>Example of a specifically built S2I-Deployment, including the preceding build in Jenkins. The more frugal way is of course to use an already existing S2I script.</i></p>
            <p>Another question posed often is for just how long our labs are available after the lab. The answer to that one is simple: For as long as you need them. Our labs are downloadable from <a target=\"new\" href=\"https://github.com/appuio/techlab/\">GitHub</a> and one of our additional labs describes in-depth <a target=\"new\" href=\"https://github.com/appuio/techlab/blob/lab-3.4/additional-labs/development_environment.md\">how to establish your own OpenShift application development environment</a>. This should remove all obstacles to give it a try at home or at work. And of course, in true Open-Source-fashion we’re glad to receive contributions and issues in order to keep improving our Techlabs.</p>
            <p>Piqued your interest? The next Techlabs will take place in August and September. We’re looking forward to many participants and are excited for new, informative experiences.</p>
