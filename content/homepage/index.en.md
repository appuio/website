# More than Container

With APPUiO you can choose between the two Kubernetes distributions Red Hat OpenShift and Rancher. These help you bring your applications into the cloud, increase productivity and promote innovation.

APPUiO offers three different ways to support you in building and/or operating a container platform. Benefit from the long experience of our specialists to integrate either OpenShift or Rancher with all its add-ons and services into your business.

# Distributions

APPUiO offers two well-established Kubernetes distributions which optimally cover different requirements for a container orchestration platform. In addition to the well-known Kubernetes features, both distributions offer additional functions and tools, which have been enhanced by the integration and combination of cloud-native products. Through a careful evaluation, APPUiO will help you to decide which of the Kubernetes distributions is right for you.

* ![OpenShift](images/openshift_schild.svg)

  ### OpenShift

  The focus of Red Hat OpenShift is on a full-stack Kubernetes platform. The platform provides end-to-end enterprise support from the operating system to the container platform to middleware applications. The OpenShift ecosystem already includes many tools to that help you with software development.
* ![Rancher](images/rancher_schild.svg)

  ### Rancher

  The focus of Rancher is to simplify the operation of Kubernetes on any infrastructure, both on-premises and cloud platforms. For this purpose Rancher Labs has developed the Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE), a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution. Rancher provides a central web and API-based multi-cluster management platform.

# Technologies

With APPUiO, you're creating new environments at the push of a button. There's a multitude of Technologies and Platforms available right "out of the Box". Docker, the foundation on which APPUiO is built, brings along a whole ecosystem of additional runtime environments and frameworks.

* ![Kubernetes](images/kubernetes_logo.svg)

  ### Kubernetes

  On APPUiO, you orchestrate and manage your containers with Kubernetes by Google. You define how many of your application instances should run in parallel and Kubernetes then takes care of scaling, load balancing and stability.
* ![Docker](images/docker_logo.svg)

  ### Docker

    Docker is the open platform for developers, sysadmins and their applications. With APPUiO, simply select the Docker-image based on your needs and the technology you want to use. OpenShift automatically creates an updated Docker-container after every build, and can even deploy it on your behalf.
