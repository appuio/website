# Included Services

* ### Backup and Monitoring

   We’re backing all relevant data up once a day. Additional, available resources are visible in the portal. On https://status.appuio.ch you can have a look at the current state of the Public Platform at all times.
* ### TCP and UDP Traffic

   With APPUiO, it’s possible to route Non-HTTP-Traffic into Public Clusters. This allows for customer IPs to be bound to services and provide for example databases, LDAP servers or SSH services publicly.
* ### Let's Encrypt Certificates

   APPUiO enables you to configure valid SSL-certificates signed by “Let’s Encrypt" into your routes at the push of a button. Once successfully registered, APPUiO automatically takes care of updating the certificates (that have a validity period of three months) when necessary.
* ### Secure Docker Builds

   Our platform allows for the running of Docker Image Native as Docker Build. To achieve this, we extracted the build-environment.Builds are running in dynamically created, strictly separated VMs per client apart from the cluster. Additionally to our secure builds, our extension enables Docker Multi-Stage Builds. These help to optimise Dockerfiles and make them both simpler and easier to read.
* ### Managed Services

   There is a first platform software, which were offering on our Public Platform as a service. We’re building the software according to your wishes and are operating it a a managed service:

  * 3 Scale API Management (Beta): API Management solution by Red Hat.
  * database as a service: manually: Postgresql, Mariadb, Mysql
  * WaF as a Service basierend auf Apache mod_sec (Beta)
* ### Persistent Storage (File based)

    On APPUiO Pubilc we offer persistent storage as file-based storage based on GlusterFS.
