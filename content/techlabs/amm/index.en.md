In the "Application Migration and Modernization Techlab" the participants learn by means of presentations and Hands-on labs how applications in their system landscape can be brought to the new container platform. It will be shown which basic architectural principles have to be considered in order to really exploit the flexibility and features of the container platform. Using a catalogue of criteria, they also learn about the different types of migration.
