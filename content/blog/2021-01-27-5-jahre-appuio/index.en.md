Unfortunately, we can't physically toast our anniversary with you at the moment. Nevertheless, we want to celebrate APPUiO in some form and have therefore come up with something different.

Our new APPUiO video is supposed to show what we have been pursuing with heart and soul since the beginning, what makes us tick, and who we are at all. It should summarise how APPUiO has developed in the last 5 years.

Also, we want to introduce you to our whole team. In a fun way, you'll meet new APPUiO members week by week on social media and the new team page. We will start on February 2, 2021 - be excited!

Now we wish you a good time, lots of patience and health 🍀.

... and we will of course catch up on the toast 🍻 , promise!

Best regards\
the APPUiO team
